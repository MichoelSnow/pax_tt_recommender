## Log Rotation

Logs are automatically created by the application. Consider implementing log rotation for production:

```bash
# Example log rotation (add to crontab)
0 0 * * * find /path/to/logs -name "*.log" -mtime +7 -delete
```

## Log Levels

- **INFO**: General operational information
- **WARNING**: Non-critical issues that should be monitored
- **ERROR**: Critical issues that need attention
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information (when enabled)

## Monitoring

Monitor these logs for:
- Import process completion and errors
- Database operation performance
- API request patterns
- System resource usage

## Cleanup

Old log files can be safely deleted to free up disk space. Consider keeping logs for at least 30 days for debugging purposes.
