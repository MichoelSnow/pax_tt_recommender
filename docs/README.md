# Documentation Index

Start here when you are unsure which document or command to use. This index is
navigation only; the linked documents are authoritative for their topics.

| Understand architecture or operational policy | [Core documentation](core/README.md) |

## Data refresh at a glance

The data workflow has three distinct phases. The choices in each phase are not
all commands to run:

1. **Collect data**: choose local collection or remote Fly collection.
2. **Process artifacts**: run the local transformations and feature builders
   needed by the destination and runtime features.
3. **Import data**: choose a local database import or a remote Fly Postgres
   import. Library import and database reset are optional operations.

The [data pipeline guide](../data_pipeline/README.md) explains the choices and
prerequisites. The [Fly ingest commands](../scripts/ingest/README.md) document
the ingest machine interface itself.

## Source of truth

This matrix identifies the canonical home for recurring topics. Other docs
should link to these sections rather than duplicate their procedures.

## Documentation lifecycle

- `installation/`
  - First-time setup and deployment guides.
  - Use this first when bringing up a new local or Fly environment.
  - Includes `migration.md` for environment-to-environment transfer workflows.
  - Includes `local_offline_kiosk_guide.md` for Windows local-host fallback during internet outages.
- `core/`
  - Evergreen human-readable docs that should remain stable over time.
  - Operational and engineering references you expect to keep long-term.
- `active/`
  - In-progress human-readable docs for current initiatives.
  - Move completed items to `archive/` when done.
- `ai/`
  - AI-oriented docs that improve agent accuracy/speed beyond reading code alone.
  - Keep concise and task-focused.
- `archive/`
  - Historical records retained for context and traceability.
- `deprecated/`
  - Superseded docs scheduled for removal after the next release.

Maintenance rule:
- Prefer updating an existing canonical doc over creating a new file.
- Docs intended for humans should be minimal and task oriented.
