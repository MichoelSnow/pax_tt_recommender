## Code writing instructions
 - Do not use emojis in any code
 - Use tenacity for retries when querying APIs
 - replace print statements with logging
 - When trying to fix code through multiple iterations make sure to clean up the old iterations before trying something new
 - Remove dead code immediately after refactors
 - Prefer single-responsibility functions with clear names
 - Avoid copy-paste divergence across files
 - Handle edge cases explicitly (empty inputs, missing data, partial failures)
 - Update docs when behavior or data flows change
 - Prefer the lowest-maintenance solution that is still safe and acceptable for production use.
 - Avoid introducing recurring operational toil (manual rotations, frequent audits, brittle workflows) unless the user explicitly requests it or it is mandatory for core security/safety.
 - For security and reliability work, favor simple, durable controls with clear defaults and minimal ongoing upkeep.


## Testing expectations
 - Add or update tests whenever behavior changes, new features are introduced, or bugs are fixed
 - Prefer unit tests for core logic; add integration tests when multiple modules interact
 - Test edge cases and failure modes (empty inputs, invalid configs, missing data, etc.)
 - Keep tests deterministic; seed randomness and avoid network calls
 - Use pytest by default for Python; keep tests fast and isolated
 - Add lightweight smoke tests for new workflows or CLI paths
 - If tests are skipped, state why and provide a manual verification step

## Command hygiene
 - Run shell commands with a 10-second timeout by default.
 - If a command exceeds 10 seconds, stop and ask the user to run it manually; do not change implementation solely to force the command under 10 seconds.
 - If a long-running command is interrupted or times out, check for partial artifacts (e.g., `node_modules` temp dirs) and either clean the affected paths or recommend a clean install before retrying.
 - Never hardcode secrets in commands. Always reference values from environment variables (loaded via `set -a; source .env; set +a`).
 - For `fly ssh console -C` commands that require nested quoting (especially embedded Python/SQL), do not use inline one-liners. Use a temporary script file and execute that script instead.

## MCPs
  - Only use the Context7 MCP when I explicitly ask for it
  - 

## Collaboration preferences
 - Assume the user has already verified that the environment is ready and that prior tests and processes are in a good state.
 - Do not repeat reminders to wait for processes, rerun tests, or confirm readiness unless a new, specific risk makes the reminder necessary.
